Here's the complete Python code that uses multiprocessing to compute ln(2) using the alternating harmonic series:

```python
import time
import multiprocessing as mp

def compute_partial_sum(start, end):
    """Compute partial sum of alternating harmonic series from start to end (inclusive)"""
    total = 0.0
    for i in range(start, end + 1):
        term = 1.0 / i
        if i % 2 == 0:  # Even index: subtract
            total -= term
        else:  # Odd index: add
            total += term
    return total

def single_threaded_computation(n_terms):
    """Compute ln(2) using single-threaded approach"""
    start_time = time.time()
    result = compute_partial_sum(1, n_terms)
    end_time = time.time()
    return result, end_time - start_time

def parallel_computation(n_terms, n_processes=4):
    """Compute ln(2) using multiprocessing approach"""
    start_time = time.time()
    
    # Split work among processes
    terms_per_process = n_terms // n_processes
    remainder = n_terms % n_processes
    
    # Create process pool
    with mp.Pool(processes=n_processes) as pool:
        tasks = []
        current_start = 1
        
        for i in range(n_processes):
            # Distribute remainder terms to first few processes
            current_end = current_start + terms_per_process - 1
            if i < remainder:
                current_end += 1
            
            tasks.append((current_start, current_end))
            current_start = current_end + 1
        
        # Submit tasks to pool
        results = pool.starmap(compute_partial_sum, tasks)
    
    # Aggregate results
    final_result = sum(results)
    end_time = time.time()
    
    return final_result, end_time - start_time

# Test with a reasonable number of terms
n_terms = 1000000
print(f"Computing ln(2) using {n_terms} terms")
print("Expected value: {:.10f}".format(0.6931471806))
print()

# Single-threaded computation
single_result, single_time = single_threaded_computation(n_terms)
print(f"Single-threaded result:  {single_result:.10f}")
print(f"Single-threaded time:  {single_time:.6f} seconds")
print()

# Parallel computation
parallel_result, parallel_time = parallel_computation(n_terms)
print(f"Parallel result:       {parallel_result:.10f}")
print(f"Parallel time:         {parallel_time:.6f} seconds")
print()

# Speedup calculation
speedup = single_time / parallel_time if parallel_time > 0 else 0
print(f"Speedup: {speedup:.2f}x")
print(f"Accuracy difference: {abs(single_result - parallel_result):.2e}")
```

This code implements the solution as requested:

1. **Alternating Harmonic Series**: The series ln(2) = 1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 + ... is computed using the `compute_partial_sum` function.

2. **Multiprocessing**: The work is split across 4 CPU cores using Python's multiprocessing module:
   - The total number of terms is divided among 4 processes
   - Any remainder terms are distributed to the first few processes
   - Each process computes its partial sum independently
   - Results are aggregated to get the final answer

3. **Performance Comparison**: Both single-threaded and multi-threaded approaches are timed and compared.

4. **Output**: Shows both results (which should be very similar) and timing information, including speedup achieved through parallelization.

The expected output would show that while the parallel approach may not achieve perfect 4x speedup due to overhead, it will still demonstrate performance improvement over single-threaded execution, especially with larger numbers of terms. The accuracy difference between approaches should be extremely small (on the order of 10^-15 or smaller).
